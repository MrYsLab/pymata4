Pymata4 is a Python 3 (Version 3.7 or above) Firmata Protocol client that, in conjunction with an Arduino Firmata sketch, permits you to control and monitor Arduino hardware remotely over a serial link. Like its asyncio sibling pymata-express, pymata4 allows the user to take advantage of the advanced feature set of the FirmataExpress (recommended) or StandardFirmata Arduino server sketches. A summary of pymata4's major features: Applications are programmed using conventional Python 3. Data change events may be associated with a callback function for asynchronous notification, or polling may be used when a synchronous approach is desired. Each data change event is time-stamped and stored. API Reference Documentation is available online. A full set of working examples are available for download online. Advantages of Using The FirmataExpress Sketch Over StandardFirmata: The data link runs at 115200, twice the speed of StandardFirmata. Advanced Arduino auto-discovery support is provided. Additional hardware support is provided for: HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensors. Stepper motors. Tone generation for piezo devices. An Intuitive And Easy To use API For example, to receive asynchronous digital pin state data change notifications, you simply do the following: Set a pin mode for the pin and register a callback function. Have your application sit in a loop waiting for notifications. When pymata4 executes your callback method, the data parameter will contain a list of items that describe the change event, including a time-stamp. Here is an object-oriented example that monitors digital pin 12 for state changes: from pymata4 import pymata4 import time class DigitalInput: \"\"\" Set a pin for digital input and received all data changes in the callback method \"\"\" def __init__(self, pin): \"\"\" Set a pin as a digital input :param pin: digital pin number \"\"\" # Indices into the callback report data self.CB_PIN = 0 self.CB_VALUE = 1 self.CB_PIN_MODE = 2 self.CB_TIME = 3 # Instantiate this class with the pymata4 API self.device = pymata4.Pymata4() # Set the pin mode and specify the callback method. self.device.set_pin_mode_digital_input(pin, callback=self.the_callback) # Keep the program running and wait for callback events. while True: try: time.sleep(1) # If user hits Control-C, exit cleanly. except KeyboardInterrupt: self.device.shutdown() def the_callback(self, data): \"\"\" A callback function to report data changes.

All Rights Reserved.","title":"TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS"},{"location":"concurrency/","text":"The Concurrency Model Introduction In this section, we discuss the concurrency model used by pymata4. According to Wikipedia, \"concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems.\" To assure the best possible performance, pymata4 needs to do the following tasks, all at the same time: Accept and process API calls from the application. Translate the API calls into Firmata formatted messages. Transmit these messages across the serial link. Continuously receive data from the serial link. Assure no data loss Decode the received data. Store information in the pymata4 internal data structures. Notify the application of data change notifications by calling the user-provided callback methods. To accomplish all this, pymata4 uses the Python threading module. It breaks its tasks into three main threads, the Command Thread , the Reporter Thread , and the Serial Data Reciever Thread . The concurrency model is depicted in the diagram below. The three threads, including the data structures used to provide for inter-thread communication, are contained in the rectangle with the solid border. This rectangle constitutes the pymata4 package. The user application is depicted on the left side of the diagram, and the Arduino containing the Firmata sketch is shown on the right. The Command Thread Whenever your application makes an API method call, it is interacting directly with the Command Thread . The API calls fall into two major categories, synchronous or blocking calls and asynchronous or non-blocking calls. Synchronous API Method Calls The synchronous API methods may be placed into two categories. Calls that poll for cached data values and calls that request report generation. Polling Method Calls read_analog read_digital i2c_read_saved_data sonar_read When the application calls one of the polling methods, the Command Thread accesses the pin data, i2c data, or sonar data structures. It then retrieves the current value for the item. The polling calls are reasonably quick in that the Command Thread reads and returns a value from one of the internal data structures. Only the Command Thread is involved in processing polling requests. Report Request Method Calls get_analog_map get_capability_report get_firmware_version get_pin_state get_protocol_version get_pymata_version When your application requests a report: A report request message is formed and sent across the serial link to the Arduino. The Command Thread waits in a blocking loop anticipating the report reply. The Arduino processes the request. It formulates a reply and sends a response over the serial link. The Serial Data Receiver Thread receives the reply, and places each character on the deque that is shared between the Serial Data Receiver Thread and the Reporter Thread . The Reporter Thread decodes the reply and places the result on an internal data structure shared with the Command Thread . The Command Thread detects that the report is available, and returns the report to the application. At this time, the Command Thread is no longer blocked. Requesting report information should only be done when necessary because of the long blocking period of the request. Asynchronous API Method Calls All other API methods calls are considered asynchronous in that they do not block. These calls only involve the Command Thread . They build a Firmata message and send the message the Arduino over the serial link. digital_pin_write digital_write disable_analog_reporting disable_digital_reporting enable_analog_reporting enable_digital_reporting i2c_read i2c_read_continuous i2c_read_restart_transmission i2c_write keep_alive play_tone play_tone_continuously play_tone_off pwm_write send_reset servo_write set_pin_mode_analog_input set_pin_mode_digital_input set_pin_mode_digital_input_pullup set_pin_mode_digital_output set_pin_mode_i2c set_pin_mode_pwm_output set_pin_mode_servo set_pin_mode_sonar set_pin_mode_stepper set_pin_mode_tone set_sampling_interval shutdown sonar_read stepper_write The Reporter Thread The Reporter Thread continuously monitors the deque to see if any data is available from the Arduino to process. If the Reporter Thread receives an input data type message, it places the latest value in one of the data structures that it shares with the Command Thread . Also, the Reporter Thread determines if there is a registered callback method for the event. If so, it calls the callback method passing in the appropriate data list. Callback methods should be written to be as fast as possible so that the Report Thread is not blocked. The Serial Data Receiver Thread The Serial Data Receiver Thread continuously monitors the serial port for incoming data. It receives data one character at a time and places the data into the deque that it shares with the Reporter Thread . It does not interpret the data since this is the job of the Reporter Thread .

Setting The FirmataExpress Instance ID FirmataExpress, in conjunction with pymata4, has the ability to automatically associate a Pymata Express application with a specific Arduino board plugged into your computer. If you only have a single Arduino connected at a time, you do not need to do anything. However, if you wish to run multiple Arduinos, you will need to assign a unique ID number to each Arduino. The ID number is then supplied as an input parameter when your application is instantiated. The Pymata Express instance parameter is discussed here .

You use this reference to access the Pymata4 methods of the instance. For example, to cleanly shutdown your Pymata4 application, you might call the shutdown method: board.shutdown() Of course, you can name the instance variable, anything that is meaningful to you. There is nothing magic about the name board . Understanding The Pymata4 __init__ Parameters def __init__(self, com_port=None, baud_rate=115200, arduino_instance_id=1, arduino_wait=4, sleep_tune=0.000001, shutdown_on_exception=True): There are many optional parameters available when you instantiate Pymata4. If you are using FiramataExpress with a single Arduino, then in most cases, you can accept all of the default parameters provided in the __init__ method. But there are times when you may wish to take advantage of the flexibility provided by the __init__ method parameters, so let's explore the definition and purpose of each parameter: The Auto-Discovery Parameters - com_port, baud_rate, and arduino_instance By accepting the default values for these parameters, pymata4 assumes you have flashed your Arduino with FirmataExpress. com_port The com_port parameter specifies a serial com_port, such as COM4 or '/dev/ttyACM0' used for PC to Arduino communication. If the default value of None is accepted, pymata4 will attempt to find the connected Arduino automatically. baud_rate The default for this parameter is 115200, matching the speed set in the FirmataExpress sketch. If you wish to use StandardFirmata instead of FirmataExpress, you will set the baud_rate to 57600. If you specify the baud_rate and accept the default com_port value, pymata4 attempts to find a connected Arduino. arduino_instance_id This parameter is only valid when using FirmataExpress. This parameter allows pymata4 to connect to an Arduino with a matching ID. This is useful if you have multiple Arduino's plugged into your computer, and you wish to have a specific Arduino selected for connection. StandardFirmata does not have this capability, and auto-discovery connects to the first Arduino it finds. This is not always the desired result. The default value for the arduino_instance_id for both pymata4 and FirmataExpress is 1. Instructions for changing the FirmataExpress value may be found in the Installing FirmataExpress section of this document. arduino_wait This parameter specifies the amount of time that pymata4 assumes it takes for an Arduino to reboot the FirmataExpress (or StandardFirmata) sketch from a power-up or reset. The default is 4 seconds. If the Arduino is not fully booted when com_port auto-discovery begins, auto-discovery will fail. sleep_tune This is the sleep value expressed in seconds, that is used at several strategic points in pymata4. For example, the serial receiver continuously checks the serial port receive buffer for an available character to process. If there is no character in the buffer, pymata4 sleeps for the sleep_tune period before checking again. The default value is 0.000001 seconds. shutdown_on_exception When this parameter is set to True, the shutdown method is automatically called when an exception is detected. This disables reporting for both digital and analog pins, in addition to closing the serial port. By setting this parameter to False, the Arduino may continue to send data to your application even after restarting it. The default is True and recommended to be used.

Preamble The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version. An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS Definitions. \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. Source Code. The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work. A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. Additional Terms. \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. Patents. A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\". A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.

The modes available to any given pin is dependent upon pin type. For example, a digital pin may be configured for input, output, and for some digital pins, PWM output operation. Analog input pins are even more flexible. They may be configured for analog input, digital input, or digital output operation. Pymata4 requires that before using a pin, its mode must be explicitly set. This is accomplished using one of the pymata4 mode setting methods. In this section, the methods to set pin modes are presented. For each API method, a link to an example is provided. ANALOG PIN MODE set_pin_mode_analog_input def set_pin_mode_analog_input(self, pin_number, callback=None, differential=1) Set a pin as an analog input. :param pin_number: arduino pin number :param callback: callback function :param differential: This value needs to be met for a callback to be invoked. callback returns a data list: [pin_type, pin_number, pin_value, raw_time_stamp] The pin_type for analog input pins = 2 Examples: analog_input_with_time_stamps.py analog_input_with_time_stamps_oo.py Notes: When an analog input message is received from Firmata, the current reported data value is compared with that of the previously reported value. If the difference, either positive or negative, is greater than the differential parameter, then the callback is invoked. This is useful when you have a \"noisy\" input that may constantly fluctuate by a small value, and you wish to ignore the noise. Pymata4 refers to analog pins using the numeric portion of the pin number only. For example, pin A3 is referred to as pin 3. Data reporting via callbacks for this pin begins immediately after this method is called.

Understanding the differences between using a callback versus polling is crucial when designing your application. Firmata Data Collection Both the FirmataExpress and StandardFirmata sketches poll all input pins within the loop method of the sketch. Firmata builds notification messages containing the pin number, pin type, and data value, and transmits these messages to pymata4 over the serial link. Firmata Data Polling Digital Input For digital input pins, all the pins are polled with each iteration of the sketch loop , with no delays. If the state of a pin has changed since the last loop iteration, Firmata creates a notification message and transmits the message over the serial link to pymata4. Analog Input For analog input pins, each pin is polled, and its current value is reported, regardless of change. All analog input pins are nominally polled every 19 milliseconds. I2C Input Unlike digital and analog inputs, most I2C devices report values only when a read request is issued to the i2c device. For these i2c devices, a read request results in a single reply. Some i2c devices may be placed in a continuous read mode. In this mode, the i2c device automatically sends update notifications, usually as quickly as possible. When in continuous i2c mode, the Firmata loop retrieves cached responses at a nominal polling rate of 19 milliseconds. Sonar (HC-SR04) Input FirmataExpress supports HC-SR04 type distance sensors. The Firmata loop polls each device and reports its current value regardless of change. The polling rate is nominally every 40 milliseconds for HC-SR04 type devices. Using Pymata4 To Access Input Data Polling For Input Data Changes As pymata4 receives input data notifications, it caches the data in internal data structures. These data structures retain the value reported as well as the time of occurrence. The application may query or poll these data structures to obtain the latest data updates for a given pin. The pymata4 API methods that implement polling are: analog_read digital_read i2c_read_saved_data sonar_read A more efficient and automatic way for your application to be notified of data updates is to use the pymata4 callback feature. Using Callbacks Instead Of Polling Callback notification is much more efficient than using polling. A callback is simply a function or method written by you, that is called automatically by pymata4 when it receives an input data notification message from Firmata. You may optionally register callback functions when using any of the following pymata4 API methods: set_pin_mode_analog_input set_pin_mode_digital_input set_pin_mode_digital_input_pullup set_pin_mode_sonar enable_analog_reporting (an alias for set_pin_mode_analog_input) i2c_read i2c_read_continuous i2c_read_restart_transmission You may write a callback function for each input pin, write a callback function to handle any pin of single type, such as analog input or digital input, or even have a single callback function handle all input data notifications. You may use callbacks with some pins while using polling for others. Polling is available for all input pins whether callbacks are in use or not. A callback function is specified to accept a single input parameter, typically named data . The input parameter will be filled with a list when pymata4 invokes the callback. A description of what is contained in the list is provided in the reference API. def my_callback(data): \"\"\" :param data: a list containing pin type, pin number, data value and time-stamp \"\"\" # Your code goes here to process the data TIP : You should keep callback functions as short as possible.
