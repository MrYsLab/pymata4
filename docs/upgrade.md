# Getting Notifications Of A New Release And How To Upgrade

## Get Notifications For New Releases From Github

If you have an account on GitHub, you can enable automatic notification when a new release is published.
If you don't have an account, you may create one on the [GitHub site.](https://github.com/)

To enable automatic notifications, go the pymata4 repository page, click on the drop-down list and select
"Releases Only." When a new release is published, you will receive an email from GitHub.
